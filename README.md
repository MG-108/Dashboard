<h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This React admin dashboard application uses Tailwind CSS and Syncfusion components, and is fully mobile responsive. Shoppyboard includes 1 dashboard, 3 pages, 4 apps, and 7 charts.</p>
<h2>Application Features and Demo</h2>
  <p>The theme settings button in the bottom right corner allows users to choose between dark and light mode and six different color options.</p>
  <p>The sidebar in the left corner has a menu button that opens or closes it. On mobile devices, the sidebar is closed by default, while on other devices it is open by default.</p>
  <h3>Dashboard</h3>
  <p>The ecommerce page includes a nice view of all the most important metrics such as earnings, revenue updates, recent transactions, btc wallet, and more.</p>
  <h3>Pages</h3>
  <p>The Orders page includes a table with the ability to filter by categories, edit only the price, delete, and pagination.</p>
  <p>The Employees page includes a table with functional search by name or designation, filtering functionalities (edit the designation, hire date, and "reports to"), delete, and pagination.</p>
  <p>The Customers page includes a table that is almost fully editable. Users can select multiple rows and delete them, as well as edit each row individually.</p>
  <h3>Apps</h3>
  <p>The Calendar page is a fully functional calendar app. Users can edit events, add new ones, drag and drop them, and change the view by day, week, month, or agenda.</p>
  <p>The Kanban board page is similar to Trello. Users can edit, add, delete, and drag and drop tasks.</p>
  <p>The Editor page is a basic app where users can modify text.</p>
  <p>The Color picker includes two options: inline palette (choose a color and display it on the pen) and inline picker (choose a color and get the HEX or RGB number of the color).</p>
